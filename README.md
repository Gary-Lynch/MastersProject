# MastersProject
The python notebooks for my Masters Dissertation project.

This dissertation project uses Twitter data drawn from Meltwater. The first notebook shows how the data is loaded, cleaned and the network analysis/media usage work. 

The second file describes the Youtube web scraping process.

Any questions relatng to this code, please reach out to me at gary.lynch1@ucdconnect.ie.
